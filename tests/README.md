### Running functional tests

By default the functional tests are not run when executing `cargo test`. To run
them, run `cargo test -- --ignored`.

Before running the functional tests, start the docker containers first with
`docker-compose up`. 

Docker creates and mounts a volume in the `data_dir` directory. The owner of
this directory is the root user, so ownership has to be changed before running
the functional tests with `sudo chown -R $USER data_dir`.

Alternatively, the regtest setup can be run directly on the host, with the tests
expecting the following endpoints:

- Bitcoind rpc cookie at `./tests/data_dir/regtest/.cookie`
- Bitcoind at `http://localhost:18443`
- Electrs at `tcp://localhost:50001`
- Monerod at `http://localhost:18081` run with arguments `--regtest --offline --fixed-difficulty 1`
- Two instances of Monero-wallet-rpc at `http://localhost:18083` and `htp://localhost:18084` run with arguments `--disable-rpc-login --wallet-dir wallets`
